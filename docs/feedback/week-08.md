# Meeting
#### Meeting Organization
Pass.
There was a chairman and a minute taker.

#### Agenda 
Excellent.
Your agenda looks good and clear, and includes relevant talking points. The time estimates also make sense.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
Excellent.
The notes follow the discussion and are clear and complete. You also included agreements you reached during the meeting. Good job!

#### Chair performance
Very good.
You guided the meeting nicely. It felt a bit rushed at times (it went faster than the expected times in the agenda), but it was still good. You listened to people’s opinions and followed the points of the agenda.

#### Attitude & Relation
Excellent.
The atmosphere was constructive and friendly and all of you contributed to the discussion. Good job!

#### Potentially Shippable Product
Insufficient.
Even though you had some nice additions since last week’s version, you don’t have any instance of websockets or long polling. These are basic requirements and can also introduce a few bugs in your code, so you should get started as soon as possible.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
Very good.
From what I’ve heard, it seems like all of you are contributing to the project. Take this with a grain of salt though, as I only base my assessment on what was said during the meeting.
