#### 1) Self-organization
Sufficient
Your tone was friendly, and actually getting along with your team helps with having good teamwork. However, what you should try to do better is include everyone in the conversation - not all team members were involved in the last bit of conversation. The main purpose of this meeting was getting to know each other, and therefore the last part of the meeting didn't contribute to it. You should make sure that, in future meetings, everyone is involved. If you are comfortable speaking a lot and sharing your opinion, make sure that you ask for the others' opinions and actively listen to them. If you are usually a bit more reluctant to share your opinion, try to step out of your comfort zone and say your thoughts on the topic. Effective communication and teamwork implies including everyone as much as possible in the process - you never know whose perspective will save the project :)

#### 2) Suggested Topics
Good
You covered the suggested topics, but ideally you could've gone more in depth. For example, what were your thoughts about each point of the Code of Conduct? Also, you could have discussed when the next meeting would be or what your strengths are.
