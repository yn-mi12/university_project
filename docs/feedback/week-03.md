# Meeting
#### Meeting Organization
Pass.
There was a chairman and a minute taker.

#### Agenda 
Very good.
Great agenda, it has all the necessary points and follows the template. However, make sure you explain the points a bit more, where needed (what do you mean with "Progress on Code of Conduct"?). 

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
Good.
Nice minutes, they contain the conclusions you reached clearly and concisely. However, ideally, you should include some more notes about what has been discussed, not only about the conclusions you reached. The notes should follow the flow of the discussion (don't get me wrong, you shouldn't write too much either). 

#### Chair performance
Very good.
You ensured that all the topics on the agenda were covered for roughly the expected amount of time. As improvement, you should guide the discussions a bit more. Make sure that everyone is heard and that the discussion doesn't stray away from the topic.

#### Attitude & Relation
Very good. 
Great atmosphere, it is nice that all of you contribute to the discussion, are not afraid to say your opinions, and are friendly with each other. Even though the discussions were generally constructive, sometimes you have the tendency to stray away from the topic. Also, it is nice that you take into account each other's opinions. However, make sure that you avoid "group think" - the tendency to not challenge an idea that was put forward by others (it hinders progress).

#### Potentially Shippable Product
Very good.
You made some good progress since last week, and you are on track to create a good, working final product. There is not much else to say, as this is the first version of the application. Good job, keep it up!

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
Insufficient.
There wasn't a discussion about what each one of you did last week, and if you managed to complete your tasks. It would be great to include a small section during the meeting in which you take short turns (~20-30 seconds) explaining what you did the previous sprint. Also, make sure that your tasks are as equally distributed (in terms of both topics and weights) as possible. You can work only on one topic in a week, but by the end of the project you should be familiar with all the technologies presented in the course.
