# Meeting
#### Meeting Organization
Pass.
There was a chairman and a minute taker.

#### Agenda 
Very good.
The agenda looks good, it contains relevant discussion topics and the estimated times make sense. However, it doesn’t have a point for talking about what each one of you did last week. 

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
Sufficient.
The notes follow the discussion, but they don’t contain the conclusions of your discussion or any agreements. How should admin authorization be used on endpoints? What are the details of the next meeting?

#### Chair performance
Very good.
Even though some topics were out of order, you managed to cover all of the topics on the agenda for an appropriate time. You kept things on track when the discussion went on a tangent.

#### Attitude & Relation
Excellent.
The atmosphere was overall constructive and you were all involved in the conversation. Good job!

#### Potentially Shippable Product
Good.
There has been some significant progress since last week. You seem to be on track to finish at least the basic requirements by the end of the course.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
Very good.
It seems like all of you contributed to the project. As before, I cannot clearly assess this just from the conversation.
