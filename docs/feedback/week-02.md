# Meeting
#### Meeting Organization
Pass.
There were a chairman and a minute taker.

#### Agenda 
Very good. 
Your agenda is generally good, and its structure makes sense. However, it would help to detail more what you plan to discuss in some of the steps (for example, the Code of Conduct one).

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
N/A

#### Chair performance
Excellent.
You guided the meeting well and you consistently tried to keep the meeting on track. You followed the agenda well. Don't be afraid to cut some discussions short if you feel like they are counterproductive or don't fit the timestamps of the agenda.

#### Attitude & Relation
Good.
You seem to get along well, but the meeting was quite chaotic. Try to stick to the agenda and to avoid having tangential conversations during the meeting (keep them for after the meeting). Please ensure that every one of you is involved in the discussion (ask for others' opinions, and also try to voice your opinion yourselves). 

#### Potentially Shippable Product
N/A

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
Excellent.
There was not a lot to do for the project this week, so I cannot say a lot here. It seems like you divide the tasks equally, at least for the Code of Conduct. Please continue to do so :)
