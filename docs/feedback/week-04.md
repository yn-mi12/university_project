# Meeting
#### Meeting Organization
Pass.
There was a chairman and a minute taker.

#### Agenda 
Very good.
Great agenda, with clear points and time estimations. You should add a section for discussing what each one of you has done the previous week. Also, I feel like some time estimates are a bit unrealistic. For example, do you think that deciding the design of the interface would only take 2 minutes?

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
Excellent.
You have written down the conclusions and any relevant information about the talking points. The notes are clear and contain concrete agreements.

#### Chair performance
Good.
You covered the points in the agenda, even though not in the exact order or for the exact times. Also, make sure that you ask your teammates for their input on a topic if you see that they don't say a lot.

#### Attitude & Relation
Very good.
You were all active during the meeting, and the discussions were constructive. It was nice that you were taking each other's ideas into account. The meeting felt a bit chaotic at times, but nothing too concerning.

#### Potentially Shippable Product
Sufficient.
You are on track to finish the project. There was some good progress since last week. I suggest you to pick up the pace a little, and to make sure that you, as a team, work on both frontend and backend every week, so that you have new fully-functioning features every week. If you only work on the backend, it is difficult for me to assess your progress.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
Excellent.
From what I have seen during the meeting, it seems like you divide the tasks equally and that everyone is involved in the project. Keep in mind that I only get this information from the meeting, so take the "Excellent" with a grain of salt, especially if you feel like the work is not actually equally distributed.
