# Meeting
#### Meeting Organization
Pass.
There was a chairman and a minute taker.

#### Agenda 
Excellent. 
Your agenda is good - it covers relevant topics and has timestamps that make sense. Good job!

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
Good.
Your notes follow the discussion and are clear. However, they don’t contain the agreements you reached or the conclusion of each discussion point. For example, what action should an admin be able to carry out?

#### Chair performance
Excellent.
You covered the topics of the agenda for the appropriate amount of time. You also asked people for their opinion and guided the discussion nicely. However, sometimes the discussion was going a bit off-topic. In these cases, you set it back on track in a short time. Good job!

#### Attitude & Relation
Excellent.
The atmosphere was nice, friendly and constructive. Everyone contributed to the conversation and had a chance to say their opinion. Nice!

#### Potentially Shippable Product
Sufficient.
You should work a bit more on the UI, as it is quite simple currently. You seem to be on track to finish the project by the end of the course.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team
Excellent. 
From what I’ve heard during the meeting, it seems like all of you are involved in the project and doing your tasks. Keep it up!
