## Communication:
Effective communication is essential for collaboration, productivity, and maintaining a positive environment. The following guidelines outline our expectations for communication among group members:
- **Respect and Courtesy**: Treat all group members with respect, kindness, and courtesy. Refrain from using offensive language, derogatory remarks, or engaging in personal attacks.
- **Active Listening**: Listen to what others have to say and do not interrupt them. Participate in discussions and provide your suggestions.
- **Constructive Feedback**: Provide feedback in constructive and helpful manner. Offer suggestions for improvement and be open to receive feedback and suggestions yourself.
- **Communication channels**: Use WhatsApp to chat with others and discuss issues about project. The WhatsApp must be available to all group members. To contact TA, use Mattermost.
- **Deadlines**: Respect deadlines and timelines for communication. Respond promptly to messages, emails, or requests for input to ensure smooth progress and avoid delays in the project. In case of inability to meet deadlines, inform other team members.
- **Clarity and Conciseness**: When communicating ideas or instructions, strive for clarity and conciseness. Use clear and understandable language and avoid ambiguity or unnecessary complexity. If something is unclear, do not hesitate to ask to avoid future conflicts.
- **Privacy**: Respect the privacy of individuals within the group. Do not share their confidential information without proper consent.
- **Adherence to Guidelines**: Adhere to all communication guidelines outlined in this code of conduct. If you observe any violations, concerns, or ambiguities, raise others awareness towards the issue and do your best to solve it.

## Target
Knowing our targets and ambitions is essential to understand our goals for the project, create reasonable time frames and plans:
- **Teamwork**: Remember that everyone is working in a team. Consider their goals and help team members achieve them.
- **Grade*8: Everyone wants to pass the course, so getting a passing grade is bare minimum. The average target grade is 8. Nonetheless, everyone should do their best to achieve the best grade.
- **Backlog goals**: Implement all features detailed in product backlog.
- **Adjustments to targets**: Reflect on progress in the group. If unable to implement all features before the deadline, consider which features can be dropped and which should remain.
